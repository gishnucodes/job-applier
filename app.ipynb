      "Feedback for HR Professional:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **GPA:** The job description explicitly requires a minimum 3.0 GPA.  While the resume mentions academic achievements, it omits the GPA.  Adding the GPA, especially if it meets or exceeds 3.0, is crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **US Work Authorization:**  The job description mentions \"Authorization to work in the U.S. without restrictions or need for Charter Sponsorship.\"  Explicitly stating this in the resume (e.g., in the Availability section) would remove any ambiguity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Microsoft Office Skills:** The Preferred Qualifications list proficiency in Microsoft Word and Excel. While these are common skills, explicitly mentioning them in the Technologies section would further align the resume with the job description and potentially boost the ATS score.  Consider adding \"Microsoft Office Suite\" or similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **AWS Experience (if any):**  While not required, AWS experience is listed as a preferred qualification. If Gishnu has *any* experience with AWS services (even basic), it would be beneficial to include it.  Even mentioning familiarity with AWS concepts or coursework related to cloud computing could be helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Teamwork Emphasis:** The job description emphasizes teamwork multiple times. While the resume mentions team collaborations, strengthening this aspect could be beneficial.  For example, quantify contributions to team projects whenever possible (e.g., \"Collaborated with a team of 5 engineers to deliver X project, resulting in Y outcome\").\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Quantify Project Impacts:**  Wherever possible, quantify the impact of projects. For example, instead of \"Engineered a system to enrich client profiles and perform risk assessment,\" consider adding a measurable outcome, such as \"Improved risk assessment accuracy by X%.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Tailor Objective to Spectrum:** The objective summary is good, but it could be even stronger by mentioning Spectrum directly. For example, \"Eager to apply my skills... within a dynamic internship environment *like Spectrum's, particularly contributing to projects related to [mention a specific area of interest within Spectrum, if possible]*.\"\n",
